ðŸ”¹ 1. Add Event Listener to the Form
javascript

document.getElementById("loginForm").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
This line adds a submit event listener to a form with the ID loginForm.

When the form is submitted, it will execute the function inside instead of its default behavior.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Prevent Default Form Submission
javascript
event.preventDefault();
Prevents the form from actually submitting and refreshing the page.

This is important for doing client-side validation before submitting.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Get Input Values and Error Elements
javascript
let email = document.getElementById("email").value;
let password = document.getElementById("password").value;
let emailError = document.getElementById("emailError");
let passwordError = document.getElementById("passwordError");
Retrieves the email and password input values.

Also fetches the elements where error messages will be displayed (emailError, passwordError).

ðŸ”¹ 4. Clear Any Previous Error Messages
javascript
emailError.innerText = "";
passwordError.innerText = "";
Clears any existing error messages from previous form submissions.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Start Validation Process
javascript
let isValid = true;
A flag to keep track of whether all validations pass.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Validate Email Format
javascript
let emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;q
if (!emailPattern.test(email)) {
    emailError.innerText = "Please enter a valid email address.";
    isValid = false;
}
Uses a regular expression to check if the email format is valid:

Must contain @, no spaces, and at least one ..

If invalid, shows an error and sets isValid to false.


The regular expression emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/; is used to validate email addresses. Let's break it down:

Components:
/^ - Start of the string

[^\s@]+ - One or more characters that are NOT whitespace or @

[^\s@] means "any character except whitespace or @"

+ means "one or more of these"

@ - The literal @ symbol (required in emails)

[^\s@]+ - One or more characters that are NOT whitespace or @ (domain name part)

\. - A literal dot (escaped with \ because . has special meaning in regex)

[^\s@]+ - One or more characters that are NOT whitespace or @ (top-level domain)

$/ - End of the string  



ðŸ”¹ 7. Validate Password Strength
javascript
let passwordPattern = /^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])[A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*]{8,}$/;
if (!passwordPattern.test(password)) {
    passwordError.innerText = "Password must be at least 8 characters long and include a number and special character.";
    isValid = false;
}
Uses another regular expression to check password rules:

Must be at least 8 characters long.

Must include at least one number and one special character.

If invalid, displays an error message and sets isValid to false.


This regular expression is for password validation with the following requirements:

^ and $ - Anchors to match the entire string from start to end

(?=.*[0-9]) - Positive lookahead to ensure at least one digit (0-9) exists

(?=.*[!@#$%^&*]) - Positive lookahead to ensure at least one special character from the set !@#$%^&* exists

[A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*]{8,} - Matches any combination of letters (upper/lower case), digits, and the specified special characters, with a minimum length of 8 characters

So this pattern requires passwords that:

ðŸ”¹ 8. Final Check and Feedback
javascript
if (isValid) {
    alert("Login successful!");
    // Here you can proceed with form submission or authentication logic.
}
If all validations passed (isValid is still true), show an alert saying "Login successful!"

This is where you would normally submit the form or call a login API.
